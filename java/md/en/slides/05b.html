## Class relationships

- Class are not isolated elements in a program, they need to interact or be combined with other classes
- Main class relationships
   - Associations
   - Inheritance
   - Dependency

</script>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Class associations

- Relationship between two classes, in which one of them is part of the elements of the other one
- An object or array of one of the classes is an attribute or instance variable of the other class
- Defined as a *Has-A* relationship

## Class associations

A *Book* has an *Author*

```java
class Author 
{
    private String name;
    private int yearBirth;

    public Author(String name, int yearBirth) 
    {
        this.name = name;
        this.yearBirth = yearBirth;
    }

    public String getName() 
    {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) 
    {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public int getYearBirth() {
        return yearBirth;
    }

    public void setYearBirth(int yearBirth) {
        this.yearBirth = yearBirth;
    }
}

class Book 
{    
    private String title;
    private int numPages;
    private double price;
    private Author author;

    public Book(String title, int numPages, double price, Author author) 
    {
        this.title = title;
        this.numPages = numPages;
        this.price = price;
        this.author = author;
    }

    ...

    public Author getAuthor() 
    {
        return author;
    }

    public void setAuthor(Author author) 
    {
        this.author = author;
    }
}

public class BookExample 
{    
    public static void main(String[] args) 
    {
        Author a = new Author("J.R.R. Tolkien", 1892);

        // The lord of the Rings, 850 pages, 13.50 eur, Tolkien
        Book b = new Book("The lord of the Rings", 850, 13.50, a);

        // Print book title and author's name
        System.out.println(b.getTitle());
        System.out.println(b.getAuthor().getName());
    }
}
```

## Class associations

If we want to associate the same author to many books, we must use the same object

```java
Author a1 = new Author("J.R.R. Tolkien", 1892);
Author a2 = new Author("J.R.R. Tolkien", 1892);  
// a2 is not the same than a1 (different objects in memory)

Book b1 = new Book("The lord of the Rings", 850, 13.50, a1);
Book b2 = new Book("The hobbit", 345, 8.76, a2);  // Different author
Book b3 = new Book("The hobbit", 345, 8.76, a1);  // Same author
```

## Exercise 1

Improve exercise *TeamsExample.java* from previous document in another source file called **TeamsExample2.java**. Now every team will have an array of 5 players. Add a new class called `Player` to the source file. For each player, we need to define his/her name, age and back number. Add the corresponding constructor and getters/setters. Then, modify `Team` class to store 5 *Player* objects, and adapt your main function to create a team with all the players inside it. Print the information of the team, including the players that belong to it.

## Exercise 2

Improve exercise *VideoGameList.java* from previous document in another source file called **VideoGameList2.java**. Now, every video game has a *Company* that created it. For every company, we need to store its name and the foundation year. Associate a company to each video game, so that some video games can share the same company object. Then, modify the main application to specify the company information for every videogame (besides video game initial data). Make sure that you share the same *Company* object among all the video games belonging to the same company.

## Association navigability

- Associations are (or can be) bi-directional
- A Book has one author, and an author can have many books

<div align="center">

</div>

</script>
</section>
    
<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Association navigability

- If we want an association to be unidirectional, we need to define an arrow pointing to the direction of the association
- Example: we can get the author from a book object, but not the opposite

## Example of a bi-directional association (first try)

```java
class House
{
    private String address;
    private int rooms;
    private LivingRoom livingRoom;

    public House(String address, int rooms, LivingRoom livingRoom)
    {
        this.address = address;

        LivingRoom lr = new LivingRoom(40, ???);    // Where's the house??
        House h = new House("Java Street", 3, lr);  // LivingRoom is OK        
    }
}
```

</section>

<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Example of a bi-directional association (second try)

One of the constructors can't refer to the other class, and the other constructor completes the task

```java
class LivingRoom
{
    private int area;
    private House house;

    // We make a living room without assigning a house here
    public LivingRoom(int area)
    {
        this.area = area;
        // House remains unassigned
    }

    public int getArea()
    {
        return area;
    }

    public void setArea(int area)
    {
        this.area = area;
    }

    public House getHouse()
    {
        return house;
    }

    public void setHouse(House house)
    {
        this.house = house;
    }
}

class House
{
    private String address;
    private int rooms;
    private LivingRoom livingRoom;

    public House(String address, int rooms, LivingRoom livingRoom)
    {
        this.address = address;
        this.rooms = rooms;
        this.livingRoom = livingRoom;
        // Assign the livingRoom to this house
        this.livingRoom.setHouse(this);
    }

    public String getAddress()
    {
        return address;
    }

    public void setAddress(String address)
    {
        this.address = address;
    }

    public int getRooms()
    {
        return rooms;
    }

    public void setRooms(int rooms)
    {
        this.rooms = rooms;
    }

    public LivingRoom getLivingRoom()
    {
        return livingRoom;
    }

    public void setLivingRoom(LivingRoom livingRoom)
    {
        this.livingRoom = livingRoom;
    }
}

class Main
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        LivingRoom lr = new LivingRoom(40);
        House h = new House("Java Street", 3, lr);
        // At this point, association is already bi-directional
    }
}
```

<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Exercise 3

Create a source file called **BookAssociation.java**. Add the `Book` and `Author` class that we have already implemented in previous example, and try to make this association bi-directional. In this case, you need to add a `Book` array as an attribute in `Author` class, and add the corresponding code to add books to each author's array.

</script>
</section>
    
<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Aggregations and compositions

- Special type of associations in which one of the classes is considered as a whole thing, and the other one is a part of this whole thing
- **Composition**: the part can't exist without the whole thing. Example: a `Room` is part of a `House` (and only of that house)
- **Aggregation**: the part can exist without the whole thing. Example: a `Player` who is part of a `Team`

</script>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Composition in practice

- We need to make sure that the part can't be extracted from the whole thing
- It needs to be private, and it needs to be constructed from withing the whole thing
- No getters should be provided to access this part

</script>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Composition in practice

```Java
class Car 
{
    private final Engine engine;

    public Car(EngineParams params) 
    {
        engine = new Engine(params);
    }
}
```

</script>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Aggregation in practice

- We implement aggregations as normal associations
- Compositions are commonly implemented this way as well (so they are not compositions in practice)

</script>
</section>
    
<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Aggregation in practice

```Java
class Car 
{
    private Engine engine;

    public Car(Engine engine) 
    {
        this.engine = engine;
    }

    public Engine getEngine()
    {
        return engine;
    }

    ...
}
```

</script>
</section>
    
<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Class inheritance

- We use **inheritance** when we want to create a new class that takes all the features of another one, adding its particular ones
- Example: a *Dog* class that inherits from an *Animal* class
- Defined as an *Is-A* relationship

</script>
</section>
    
<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Class inheritance: example

Comic inherits from Book

```java
class Comic extends Book
{
    private boolean color;
    private int volumeNumber;

    public Comic(String title, int numPages, double price,
        boolean color, int volumeNumber)
    {
        this.title = title;
        this.numPages = numPages;
        this.price = price;
        this.color = color;
        this.volumeNumber = volumeNumber;
    }

    public boolean getColor()
    {
        return color;
    }

    public void setColor(boolean color)
    {
        this.color = color;
    }

    public int getVolumeNumber()
    {
        return volumeNumber;
    }

    public void setVolumeNumber(int volumeNumber)
    {
        this.volumeNumber = volumeNumber;
    }
}
```

</script>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Class inheritance: terms

- The new class that inherits from the general one is called *subclass* or *child class*
   - *Comic* class in our example
- The class that is being inherited is called *superclass* or *parent class*
   - *Book* class in our example

</script>
</section>
    
<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Visibility and inheritance

- We need to use **protected** visibility in the elements of a parent class that need to be accessed from within a child class
- This is an intermediate level of visibility, between *public* and *private*, suitable for inheritance

</script>
</section>
    
<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Visibility and inheritance

```java
class Book
{
    protected String title;
    protected int numPages;
    protected double price;

    // The rest of code does not change
}
```

</script>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Visibility summary (higher to lower)

- **public**: elements can be accessed from any other part of the code
- **protected**: elements can only be accessed from any subclass of current class, or any class from the same package than current class
- *package* (default): elements are only accessible from the same package.
- **private** elements can only be accessed from current class

</script>
</section>
    
<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Overriding parent methods

- We can modify (*override*) the behavior of parent methods in child class
- We re-type the method again with **@Override** annotation, and make any changes in the code

</script>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Overriding parent methods

```java
class Book
{
    ...
    public void printInformation()
    {
        System.out.println("Book information:");
        System.out.println("Title: " + title);
        System.out.println("Pages: " + numPages);
        System.out.println("Price: " + price);
    }
}

class Comic extends Book
{
    ...

    @Override
    public void printInformation()
    {
        System.out.println("Book information:");
        System.out.println("Title: " + title);
        System.out.println("Pages: " + numPages);
        System.out.println("Price: " + price);
        System.out.println("Color/Grayscale: " + 
            (color?"Color":"Grayscale"));
        System.out.println("Volume: " + volumeNumber);
    }
}
```

</script>
</section>
    
<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Using *super*

- The word *super* lets us access any part of parent code, so we can reuse it in child class
- Can be used in:
   - Constructors (to rely on parent constructor). Needs to be the first instruction in child constructor
   - Methods (to reuse code of the methods)

</script>
</section>
    
<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Using *super*

```java
class Comic extends Book
{
    public Comic(String title, int numPages, double price,
    boolean color, int volumeNumber)
    {
        super(title, numPages, price);
        this.color = color;
        this.volumeNumber = volumeNumber;
    }
    
    ...

    @Override
    public void printInformation()
    {
        super.printInformation();
        System.out.println("Color/Grayscale: " + 
            (color?"Color":"Grayscale"));
        System.out.println("Volume: " + volumeNumber);
    }
}
```

</section>
    
<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Extending Object class

- Every class in Java inherits from a global, parent class called `Object`, unless we specify another inheritance
- We can use or override methods from this class, such as `equals` or `toString`

</script>
</section>
    
<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## toString method

Defines a string representation of an object, so we can easily print them on the screen

```Java
public class Person 
{
    private String name;
    private int age;

    public Person(String n, int a) 
    {
        name = n;
        age = a;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() 
    {
        return name + " (" + age + " years)";
    }
}

// Main
Person p = new Person("Nacho", 40);
System.out.println(p); // Prints "Nacho (40 years)"
```

</script>
</section>
    

<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## equals method

Defines a comparison criteria to determine if two objects of the class are the same

```Java
public class Person 
{
    private String name;
    private int age;

    public Person(String n, int a) 
    {
        name = n;
        age = a;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() 
    {
        return name + " (" + age + " years)";
    }

    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object p) 
    {
        Person p2 = (Person) p;
        return this.name.equals(p.name) && this.age == p.age;
    }
}

// Main
Person p1 = new Person("Nacho", 40);
Person p2 = new Person("Nacho", 39);

if (p1.equals(p2)) 
{
    System.out.println("They are equal!");
} else {
    System.out.println("They are different");
}
```

## Polymorphism

- Ability of an element to have multiple shapes or appearances
   - A class can have many methods with the same name and different number or types of parameters
   - An object of any class can behave like any of its subclasses

</script>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Polymorphism: example

- A *Car* and a *Motorcycle* are subtypes of *Vehicle*
- We can instantiate a *Vehicle* using a *Car* or *Motorcycle* object

```Java
Vehicle myCar = new Car(...);
```

</script>
</section>
    
<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Polymorphism: example

- A *Car* and a *Motorcycle* are subtypes of *Vehicle*
- We can use a *Car* or *Motorcycle* object as a parameter in a function that expects a *Vehicle*

```Java
public void aMethod(Vehicle v) 
{
    ...
}

...
Car anotherCar = new Car(...);
aMethod(anotherCar);
```

</script>
</section>
    
<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Polymorphism: example

- A *Car* and a *Motorcycle* are subtypes of *Vehicle*
- We can fill an array of *Vehicle* objects with *Car* and/or *Motorcycle* objects

```Java
Vehicle[] vehicles = new Vehicle[10];

vehicles[0] = new Vehicle(...);
vehicles[1] = new Car(...);
vehicles[2] = new Motorcycle(...);
...
```

</script>
</section>
    
<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Polymorphism restrictions

- Polimorphic variable can only access elements of parent class (even though it is a subclass object)
- If we create a `Car` object and store it in a `Vehicle` variable, then we will only be able to call methods or public elements from `Vehicle` class (not from `Car` class)

</script>
</section>
    
<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Polymorphism: detecting subtype

We can check if a polymorphic variable is of a concrete subtype with **instanceof** operator, so we can typecast it and use its methods

```java
Vehicle[] vehicles = new Vehicle[10];
... // Fill the array with many vehicle types
for (int i = 0; i < vehicles.length; i++)
{
    if (vehicles[i] instanceof Car)
    {
        System.out.println(((Car)vehicles[i]).getNumberOfDoors());
    } else if (vehicles[i] instanceOf Van) {
        ...
    } ...
}
```

## Exceptions and inheritance

- Every exception in Java inherits from parent **Exception** class, unless it inherits from any other subtype
- We can define our own exception types that inherit from this parent class (or any other exception)

</script>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Exceptions and inheritance

```java
public class CustomException extends Exception 
{
    public CustomException(String msg) 
    {
        super(msg);
    }
}

public class Store 
{
    public void welcome() throws CustomException 
    {
        throw new CustomException("Error, nobody can pass!");

public static void main(String[] args) 
{

## Class dependency

- Establishes a connection between two classes when one of them uses an object of the other one in some part of its code, BUT there's no association between them
