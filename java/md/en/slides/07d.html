## File management
### Object serialization

## Serialization

- Convert an object into a sequence of bytes
- This way we can send/receive the object through a given stream or communication channel
- It also lets us store/retrieve objects easily in files

</script>

## Serialization in Java

- Make the class implement *Serializable* interface
   - No methods to be implemented
- Every internal attribute of the class must be simple or serializable

</script>

## Serialization in Java

```java
class Person implements Serializable
{
    private String name;
    private int age;

    ...
}
```

</script>
</section>
    
<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Transient elements

We can tag some attributes as *transient* just not to serialize them

```java
class Person implements Serializable
{
    private String name;
    // Age will not be serialized
    private transient int age;

    ...
}
```

</script>
</section>
    
<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Writing serialized objects

We use **ObjectOutputStream** class with **writeObject** method

```java
try(ObjectOutputStream oos =
    new ObjectOutputStream(new FileOutputStream("people.dat")))
{
    oos.writeObject(new Person("John", 49));
    oos.writeObject(new Person("Susan", 45));
}
catch (IOException e)
{
    System.err.println("Error storing people");
}
```

</script>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Reading serialized objects

We use **ObjectInputStream** class with **readObject** method

```java
try(ObjectInputStream ois =
    new ObjectInputStream(new FileInputStream("people.dat")))
{
    // An exception is thrown when we get to the end of file
    while(true)
    {
        Person p = (Person)(ois.readObject());
        System.out.println(p);
    }
}
catch (Exception e)
{
    System.err.println("Error storing people");
}
```

</script>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Serializing collections

We can do it all at once, as long as the elements inside the collection are serializable

```java
List<Person> people = new ArrayList<>();
people.add(new Person(...));
people.add(new Person(...));
oos.writeObject(people);
...
List<Person> people2 = (List<Person>)(ois.readObject());
```

</script>
</section>

<section data-markdown>

## Associations and serialization

- If we have an association between two classes whose objects are being serialized, we don't need to care about the association
- For instance, if we store a couple of books sharing the same author, this author will still be shared between these books when we read them from the file.

## Exercise

Create a project called **TaskSerializer**, with the following elements:
 
* A class called `Task` in which we are going to store its description and the date to be finished (a string with the format *dd/mm/yyyy*).
* The main program will try to read a list of tasks stored in a file called *tasks.dat* at the beginning, and print them in the screen. Then, it will ask the user if he/she wants to add a new task to the list. At the end, the new list will be written in the file before closing the program.
