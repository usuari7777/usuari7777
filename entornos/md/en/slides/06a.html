### Introduction to software testing
</script>
</section>

## Software testing

- One of the stages in the software development process
- Really important (watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDynSmrzpXw&list=PLDC2A0C8D2EC934C7))
- They consist in the dynamic verification of the behavior of a program, with a properly selected set of test cases

</script>
</section>

## Testing targets

* Detect software failures or bugs, and make sure that every previously detected bug has been fixed.
* Verify the appropriate integration of the components.
* Verify that every requirement has been implemented.

</script>
</section>

<section data-markdown>

## Testing principles

* Test can help us find bugs, but not their absence.
* The most difficult part is to decide when to stop.
* Try to avoid test cases that are not previously planned, not reusable and/or trivial
* Test cases must be written for both valid and not valid or unexpected input.
* The more bugs we have detected with our test cases, the more bugs are waiting for us.

## Stages in software testing

1. Select what the test must detect, its main target.
2. Decide which kind of test is going to be performed and what kind of elements do we need to do it.
3. Implement the test cases. 
4. Determine the expected results of the test cases 
5. Run the test cases 

</script>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Evaluating the results

- Compare actual results with expected results
- If there is any difference, the test process has failed, due to:
   - Errors in tests themselves
   - Errors in the part of the program that is being tested

</script>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Test types

From lower to higher level

1. Unit tests
2. Integration tests
3. Acceptance or validation tests
4. System tests

</script>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Unit tests

- Check the appropriate behavior of one code unit
   - A class in object oriented programming
   - A set of functions in non object oriented languages
- Run by the development team
- They must be automatable, complete, repeatable and independent from other unit tests

</script>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Integration tests (1/2)

- Test the interface or connection among many units (or all of them)
- *Regression tests*: test a component whenever it's modified, since changes may affect other components

</script>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Integration tests (2/2)

- Techniques:
    - *Big bang*: integrate everything at once (not recommended, unless the project is too simple)
    - *Top down*: components are tested from top to down. Connections are tested before bottom components
    - *Bottom up*: bottom componentes are firstly implemented and tested, and then we test upper components
    - *Combined*: combines *top down* and *bottom up* techniques

</script>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## CI/CD

- Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment
- If all the tests have been passed, then the application is automatically deployed on its target environment
   - If deployment is manual, it's called *Continuous Delivery*

</script>
</section>
    
<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Acceptance or validation tests

- Check if every user requirement has been satisfied
- Run by the development team along with the final user or customer

</script>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## System tests

- Check if application deployment in user dependencies is successful
- Run by the development team along with the final user or customer

</script>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Test cases

*A set of input values, execution preconditions, expected results and execution postconditions, developed for a particular objective or test condition, such as to exercise a particular program path or to verify compliance with a specific requirement*

</script>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Test cases

For every test case, we must include the following information

* **Identifier**: to identify each test case
* **Name**: a descriptive (meaningful) name.
* **Preconditions**: what needs to be ready before starting the test (input file, results of other test cases...)
* **Steps**: interaction with the user (user input)
* **Test data**: concrete values to be used in the test case
* **Expected result**: what the test must produce or output
* **Actual result**: result that we actually get 

</script>
</section>

## Test cases

Example: user login

|ID|Name|Preconditions|Steps|Data|Expected result|Actual result|
|----|------|--------------|-----|----|------------------|--------------|
|U1|ValidInput1|User **pepe** exists with password 1234|Type user and password|pepe 1234|OK||
|U2|UserNotValid|User **pepito** does not exist|Type user and password|pepito 1234|error||
|U3|PasswordNotValid|User **pepe** exists with password different than 4567|Type user and password|pepe 4567|error||
|...|

## Exercise 1

Design test cases to check the behavior of a function that returns a boolean indicating if the number specified as a parameter is even or not.
