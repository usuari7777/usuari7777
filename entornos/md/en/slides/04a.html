## Origin of a software project

- The company itself (internal development): the company becomes its own customer
   - Viability may be hard to determine (is it really worth it?)
- An external entity: the company acts as a software provider
   - Viability can be easier to determine or adjust
</script>

## Project manager

- Experienced person in charge of coordinating the development process
- He/She should take part in the decision of starting the project or not
- Tasks:
   - Identify possible risk areas
   - Set budgets, calendar and task assignments
   - Support and provide communication among team members
   - ...

## Gathering requirements

- Communication with customer is an essential part of the decision-making process
- Drawbacks:
   - Developers don't know what customer exactly wants
   - Customer doesn't know what type of information is relevant for developers
- Solutions:
   - Identify relevant sources of information
   - Ask the appropriate questions
   - Check answers with customer
</script>

## Techniques for gathering information

- Interviews
- Joint Application Development (JAD)
- Observation of how company works
- Documentation study (of the official documents of the company)
- Questionnaires (useful to gather information from remote people)
- Brainstorming
</script>
</section>
    
<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Interviews

- Not just asking questions, it needs to be structured/guided 
- Stages:
   - Preparation (get information about product and company)
   - Introduction
   - Development
   - Ending
</script>
</section>
    
<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Joint Application Development

- Meetings or workshops of 2-4 days length between customer and development team 
- Customer gets involved in the product development
- Hard to fit with customer's schedule
</script>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Exercise

Determine if the following assertions are true or false

- Interviews are the most suitable way of getting information for a software project, in general
- JAD is a quick way of specifying the requirements of an application in projects where several departments of the customer company are involved
- Questionnaires are useful when we try to gather information from the customer and the components are far from each other geographically
- Only with the observation of the company or the study of its documentation we can get a SRS very accurate.

<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## System Requirements Specification (SRS)

- Document that describes as much as possible what the software product is going to do
- Made from the information gathered from previous techniques
</script>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Requirement

- A condition that the customer needs in order to solve a problem or reach a target
- E.g: quickness in an investment application
</script>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Requirement types

- **System**: physical components and additional software needed 
- **Functional**: what the system is expected to do (user log in, print reports...)
- **Non-functional**: determine how well the system meets the functional requirements (security, efficiency, ease of use...)
   - If they are not good, application still works as expected
