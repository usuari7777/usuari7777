## Software methodologies

A **methodology** is a set of techniques and methods that help us face each stage of a lifecycle. This way, we can: 

* Optimize the process and the final product
* Use guided protocols for the planning and the development
* Set what to do, how to do it and when, along all the project

</script>

## Agile methodologies

* Focus on people and final product
* Communication with customer is essential
* Short iterations
* Useful for projects with uncertain requirements or critical development time

</script>
</section>

<script type="text/template">
## Agile methodologies

* Suitable for small projects
* Suitable for projects with close deadline
* Suitable for projects with less than 10 people
* Small project increments in short periods (1-4 weeks - *timebox*)
* Documentation only generated when needed

</script>

## Agile manifesto

Principles for agile methodologies

* People are the main success factor of a project
* Constant interaction between customer and work team
* Ability to face changes is better than following a rigid plan
* Satisfy the customer with continuous deliveries
* ...

## Pair programming

* Agile practice
* Two programmers in the same computer: *driver* and *observer*
* Both swap their roles frequently (every 30 minutes)
* The *observer* guides the *driver* and provides ideas

</script>

        <h3 style="text-align:center">PROS</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>It produces shorter programs with less errors</li>
            <li>Useful for learning from experienced colleagues</li>
            <li>If one member leaves the team, the deadline is not affected</li>
            <li>Less interruptions along the process</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 style="text-align:center">CONS</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Some engineers prefer to work on their own</li>
            <li>Intimidation/Boredom if level is too different</li>
            <li>More costly</li>

## Test Driven Development (TDD)

* Agile practice
* First, produce the code to pass a set of tests 
* Then, integrate this code in the application
* Repeat last two steps until application is finished
* We make sure every piece of code is useful

## Scrum methodology

* Agile methodology
* Useful for simple and complex projects
* Name comes from the *mel√©e* of rugby players

</script>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Scrum roles

* **ScrumMaster**: make sure that the Scrum method is used properly
* **ProductOwner**: represents the customer (can be someone from the dev team)
* **Team** of developers (self-managed, no project manager)

</script>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Scrum process

* Team gathers requirements in **user stories**
* User stories are packed in a **backlog** 
* Iterations of 2-4 weeks called **sprints**:
   * ProductOwner extracts some user stories from the backlog
   * Team decides which stories are going to be included in sprint
   * Backlog *freezes* until sprint is done
* Daily meetings to discuss about the project

## Scrum time estimation

* Each user story has a time assigned (in hours, days...)
* The total time of a sprint is the sum of the times of the user stories chosen
* Using **burndown charts** we can check if estimated and real time differ too much

## Exercise

Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU0llRltyFM) about Scrum methodology and answer these questions

1. What is a *sprint* in Scrum?
2. Who is in charge of prioritizing the tasks to do in every *sprint*?
3. How can the final delivery date of a *sprint* be calculated?

## Kanban methodology

* Agile methodology
* *Kan* (visual) + *ban* (card)
* Origins in 1940s (Toyota) to optimize stock
* Important to control the WIP (*Work In Progress*)

</script>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Kanban process

* **Kanban cards** reflect critical information about a particular work item
   * Different colors for different card types (requirement, test...)
* Cards are placed in a **Kanban board** 
* Kanban board is divided in (at least) 3 sections: **To do**, **In progress** and **Done** 
* Cards flow through the board from left to right

</script>

    <img src="../../../img/ED_b1_tema03-05-kanban_board.png" alt="Kanban board" width="90%" />
</div>

</script>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Kanban principles

* **Limited WIP**: *stop starting* and *start finishing*
* **Guaranteed quality**: everything needs to go well at the first opportunity, speed is not as important as quality
* **Flexibility**: next step is decided from the *backlog*, by choosing the next task to be completed

</script>

    <h2>Kanban vs Scrum</h2>

    <div class="fragment fade-up" style="width:45%;float:left;background-color:#C2DCA3;border-radius:10px">
        <h3 style="text-align:center">SIMILARITIES</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Both agile</li>
            <li>Collaborative and self-managed teams</li>
            <li>Release software very often</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="fragment fade-up" style="width:45%;float:right;background-color:#E5977C;border-radius:10px">
        <h3 style="text-align:center">DIFFERENCES</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>No roles in Kanban</li>
            <li>Continuous deliveries in Kanban (no timeboxed sprints)</li>
            <li>Changes can be made at any time in Kanban</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <p class="fragment fade-up" style="width:100%;float:left;margin-top:10px;">Scrum can be used for short-term planning and feedback, and Kanban for daily work</p>

## Exercise

Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8dYLbJiTUE) about Kanban methodology and answer these questions:

1. What is the main function of WIP limits? 
2. What happens when we try to move a task to a column that exceeds this limit?
3. How can Kanban and Scrum be combined? Which is the main purpose of adding Scrum to Kanban?
