## Software methodologies

A **methodology** is a set of techniques and methods that help us face each stage of a lifecycle. This way, we can: 

* Optimize the process and the final product
* Use guided protocols for the planning and the development
* Set what to do, how to do it and when, along all the project

</script>
</section>

## Elements of a methodology

* **Stages**: activities that need to be done in order to finish a step of the process
* **Products**: inputs/outputs for a given stage
* **Procedures and tools**: elements that help us do each task (code editors, etc.)
* **Evaluation criteria**: determine if all the targets have been reached in each stage

</script>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Traditional methodologies

* Control every part of the process
* Set activities, reports, deliverables... of each stage
* Too rigid for some projects
* Based on some known lifecycles, such as spiral or iterative

</script>
</section>

## RUP methodology

* *Rational Unified Process*
* Traditional, but not rigid methodology
* Based on spiral lifecycle
* Includes UML (*Unified Modeling Language*) for analysis and design 

</script>
</section>

## RUP modules

* **Roles**: competences or responsibilities for people
* **Work products**: result of a task (documents, prototypes...)
* **Tasks**: work units, assigned to a specific role, produce a given work product.

Define who does the job (role), what it is about (work product) and how he does it (task).

</script>
</section>

## RUP stages

4 stages. Iterations can be performed at any stage

* **Inception**: scope of the project, requirements analysis
* **Elaboration**: the project is analyzed more in depth, its basic implementation is defined.
* **Building**: application is finally designed and implemented (many iterations and prototypes can be needed)
* **Transition**: final product is prepared for its delivery to the customer.

## Exercise

Search on the Internet about all the diagrams that we can use in UML. These diagrams can be of two types: *structural* diagrams or *behavioral* diagrams. Identify at least three diagrams of each type.

## MSF methodology

* *Microsoft solutions framework*
* Traditional, but not rigid methodology
* Based on spiral lifecycle
* Can be applied to many different project types (software, networking...)
* Excessive documentation and dependency on Microsoft products

</script>
</section>
    
<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## MSF stages

* **Vision**: we evaluate the business model and application requirements (similar to RUP's *Inception*).
* **Planning**: project development is planned according to a schedule.
* **Development**: implement the application and deliver some prototypes to the customer.
* **Stabilization**: product is tuned with its final touches.
* **Implantation and support**: application is installed in the customer's company.
