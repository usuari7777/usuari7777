## Software analysis and design
### Class diagrams

## Class diagrams

- Graphical representation of the classes of a project, and their relationships
- We focus on the different types of elements that are involved in the application
- Complementary to use case diagrams and other diagrams
</script>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Example

We are going to implement an application for an online shop. This shop will have some *customers* registered, and will sell a list of *products*. So each customer can have his/her own *shopping cart*, make *orders* and so on.

</script>
</section>
        
<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Classes

We can see that our application has customers, products, shopping carts, orders... These elements will be the **classes** of our application.

</script>
</section>
    
<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Attributes

- From each element we need to store some essential information.
- For customers: login, password, email... 
- For products: id, brand, model, price... 
- All these things are the **attributes** for each class.

</script>
</section>
    
<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Objects

- Concrete instances of each class, with concrete values for the attributes
- Example: a customer with login *john123*, password *johnny111*, and e-mail *john@gmail.com*
- There can be many objects of a class at the same time in the program
</script>
</section>
    
<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Methods

- Provide functionality to every object
- Operations that objects can do
- Example: customers need to login, add products to their shopping carts... 

</script>

## Classes in a class diagram

Rectangle divided in 3 sections: class name, attributes and methods

</section>
    
<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Access modifiers

- Represent the visibility of every element of a class (attribute or method)
- **+** for **public** visibility (can be accessed from anywhere)
- **-** for **private** visibility (can only be accessed from within current class)
- Attributes are usually private, and methods are usually public

</script>
</section>
    
<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Relationships: generalization

- Represented by an arrow
- Establishes that a class called **subclass** or **child class** inherits the elements of another class called **superclass** or **parent class**. 
- Besides, subclass can also have its own attributes and methods.

</script>

## Generalization example

<script type="text/template">
## Exercises

- Do exercises 1 and 2 of the contents of this section
   - Exercise 1 is showing a system that represents different types of ships
   - Exercise 2 is showing a system that defines different types of characters for a video game

</script>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Relationships: association

- Represented by continuous line
- It lets us link two classes that collaborate between them
- An object of a class has an object (or some objects) of the other class
- Is not a strong relationship: the lifetime of one side does not depend on the other side
</script>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Cardinality of an association

- Sets the dependency level of two classes: how many objects of one class can be associated with one object of the other class
- Types:
   - **One to many**: specified as `1..*` or `(1..n)`
   - **Zero to many**: `0..*` or `(0..n)`
   - **Fixed number**: `m` (m is a given number)

## Association example

</div>

</section>

<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Navigability in an association

An arrow in the line indicates that we can only get the objects of the edge pointed by the arrow from the other edge

</div>

<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Aggregation and composition

- Subtypes of associations in which one class is a whole and the other one is a part of this whole
- **Aggregation**: the part can exist without the whole (can be associated to another whole)
   - Represented by a white diamond
- **Composition**: the part can't exist without the whole (is destroyed if whole is also destroyed)
   - Represented by a black diamond

</script>
</section>

## Example of aggregation and composition

<section data-markdown>
<script type="text/template">
## Relationships: dependency

- Usage relationship
- A class uses another class in some part of its code
- Represented by a discontinuous arrow
   - The direction of the arrow tells us which class is being used

</script>
